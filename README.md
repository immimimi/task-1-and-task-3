The folder titled 'Rahber Login and Video Course 2' contains the code for an app demo. It is not as polished looking as I would like but given time I can make it look better.
The app allows you to register new users, login and out, and view two courses. The course links open to tutorial videos and quizes, if you sucsessfully complete the quiz, you can 
move to the next lesson. 

The 'recomenadtion_algorithum' file uses machine learning tequniques to develop a recomenadtion algorithum. There are comments that explain the code as well as 
a short explanation on the logic behind the machine learing techniques. 

My solution to task 2 is attached as a pdf to the email I sent you.
